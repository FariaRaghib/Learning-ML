# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my "100 Days of Machine Learning" repository! This project is a personal learning journey where I document my progress and insights gained from a comprehensive YouTube playlist designed to teach machine learning concepts step-by-step.

## About the Playlist

The "100 Days of Machine Learning" series consists of 100 videos, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning, data science, and related technologies. The playlist is structured to gradually build knowledge and practical skills through hands-on exercises and real-world examples.

### Current Progress

- **Video Number**: 50
- **Current Topic**: Simple Linear Regression | Code + Intuition |


## Repository Structure

This repository includes:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises related to each video.
- **Resources**: Links to additional reading materials, datasets, and relevant documentation.
- **Projects**: Any mini-projects or exercises completed during the course.
